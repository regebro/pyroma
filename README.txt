pyroma
======

Pyroma is a product aimed at giving a rating of how well a package complies
with the best practices of Python packaging, as well as a list of issues
that could be improved.

The aim of this is both to help people make a package that is nice and usable,
but also to improve the quality of Python packages, making it easier and more
enjoyable to use the vast array of third.party modules for Python.

It's written so that there are a library with methods to call from Python, as
well as a script, also called pyroma.

It can be run on a package directory before making a release, or on a
distribution before uploading it to the CheeseShop, or you can give it a package
name on CheeseShop.
