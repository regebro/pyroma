pyroma
======

Pyroma rhymes with aroma, and is a product aimed at giving a rating of how well
a Python project complies with the best practices of the Python packaging
ecosystem, primarily PyPI, pip, Distribute etc, as well as a list of issues that
could be improved.

The aim of this is both to help people make a project that is nice and usable,
but also to improve the quality of Python third-party software, making it easier
and more enjoyable to use the vast array of available modules for Python.

It's written so that there are a library with methods to call from Python, as
well as a script, also called pyroma.

It can be run on a project directory before making a release:

    $ pyroma .
    
On a distribution before uploading it to the CheeseShop:

    $ pyroma pyroma-1.0.tar.gz

Or you can give it a package name on CheeseShop:

    $ pyroma pyroma

In all cases the output is similar::

    Checking .
